sqlite3 can only see db files in its directory
open cmd prompt change directory to location of db files, then start sqlite3

sql.py output function will create a new db file if it does not already exist
sqlite3 .open dbfile.db > .tables > select * from table_name;

some csv files cant be accessed outside the project
all datafiles.csv are located at D:\RawData 
all databases.db are located at D:\RawData\DataStores
